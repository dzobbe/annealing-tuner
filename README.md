# sgxmusl-autotuner (Work In Progress)
A tool for automatic tuning of SGX Musl library parameters written in Rust. The application searches for the best configuration parameters using the Simulated Annealing algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing), a stochastic process for iterated local search.

## Requirements
Of course, you will need Rust installed. If you haven't already, get it here: [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org). Also you need Cargo [Cargo](https://crates.io) to easily compile.
